 **ðŸ™€ When something goes wrong**
 
 One of the factors that contributed to the better understanding
 of how our brain processes language was the study of when it doesn't
 happen as expected. 
 
 There are many neurological conditions that can affect language. 
 
 Let's take _aphasia_ as an example. 
 
 A patient with aphasia might have difficulties trying to figure out
 who is the person that _Johnny likes_ in the sentence to the right.
 It also wouldn't be easy to find out who didn't come to school. 
 That is an example of a _syntactic_ problem. 
 
 Another patient might be ok with the structures of the sentences, but 
 he can have a hard time trying to find the word for that cute little 
 animal that says _meow_ and likes milk... 
 
 Maybe he will say "cap" because of the phonological similarity, or
 maybe "lion" because of the semantic proximity. But actually finding
 _cat_ might be really difficult.
